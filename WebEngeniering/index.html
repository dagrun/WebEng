					<h3>Hotel Mec Paestum ***** - Paestum, Italy</h3>
					<img src="images/mec-paestum-1.jpg"  alt=""/>
					<p > We have come to visit this beautiful place which keeps record of a huge amount of historical moments, thanks to the activity of the archeologists which recovered the ruins of an entire roman city, Paestum, which was progressively abandoned by its inhabitants.<br> 
					This beautiful and flawless hotel is located near the archeological site, providing the clients a beautiful sight of the famous temples which have inspired also artists of the modern times, such as Pink Floyd. 
					<br>Local traditions have been influenced also by the Greeks, as well as Spanish, since the south of Italy has been ruled by many different powers through time.
					<br>Let yourself being drown into history and ancient traditions, enjoying both at the same time history and food.
					<br>This region's traditions include thousands of exclusive recipes with local cultivated products.
